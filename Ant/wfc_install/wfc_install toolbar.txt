!!!!----------------Creating a wfc_install toolbar-------------!!!!

This Read me file will allow you to create a Windows Toolbar with wfc_install icons for running common wfc_install commands.

The following example will allow you to create an icon for using the wfc.restage command. There are many ways to do the following. This is just a guide.

1- Create a folder in the wfc_install folder called "Shortcuts"
2- Right-click "batch\restage.bat" and select "Create a shortcut"
3- Right-click the shortcut and select "Properties"
4- On the "Shortcut" tab, click on the "Change Icon" button;
5- Select an icon and click on "OK".
6- Close the properties dialog;
7- Move the shortcut to the "Shortcuts" folder;
8- Right-click on the Windows toolbar;
9- Select the "Toolbars" item;
10- Click on the "New Toolbar" item;
11- Select the "Shortcuts" folder in the wfc_install workspace folder;
12- Right-click on the Windows toolbar and uncheck the "Lock the Toolbar" item;
13- Right-click on the new toolbar (not an item of the toolbar) and unselect "Show Text" and "Show Title";
14- Right-click on the Windows toolbar and check the "Lock the Toolbar" item;

You should now have a new toolbar with an icon allowing you to stop the server restage your db and restart you server.
You can do the same thing to create other icons such as stop the server, start the server, etc.
